Hey, Iâ€™m Tachibana Kousuke, a multi-talented individual with a bit of knowledge in computer science and art, proudly calling myself a one-man team. Currently, I'm working hard at Dongchen School.

I am now a contracted "study machine" for Dongchen High School, part of the Class of 2024, Dragon Class 17 team. I have previously participated in the class division exam and the final exam confidentiality project. During middle school, I was recruited as a student of Class 47 at Dongchen Middle School.

My current physical activity range mainly covers Mianyang and Chongqing, but I also aspire to become a digital nomad hero. My virtual self can often be found on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1323299604).
