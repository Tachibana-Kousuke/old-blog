Hello everyone, I am Awe (Tachibana Kousuke), a passionate multi-field explorer in computer science and art. Currently, I am dedicated to balancing learning and life, constantly striving for personal growth and progress.

In the field of technology, I have a strong interest in programming, digital products, and innovative projects. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and Swift, and I excel at turning creative ideas into practical outcomes through hands-on practice. Exploring technology is my greatest joy, and various devices are an indispensable part of my daily life.

Beyond programming, I have a deep interest in natural sciences like biology, physics, and mathematics. I enjoy simplifying complex concepts and sharing my understanding with others. Additionally, I am fluent in Chinese and English and actively learning Japanese to broaden my language skills and global perspective.

My life is full of dynamism and change, with my footprints covering multiple cities. In the future, I hope to become a digital nomad, working and living freely anytime and anywhere. In the virtual world, I am frequently active on communities such as [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1323299604), sharing experiences and thoughts with like-minded individuals.

Music is an essential part of my life. Taylor Swift, RADWIMPS, Harry Styles, and Jiao Maiqi are my favorite artists. Their works often inspire my thoughts and spark my creativity.
